/// Represents a [Mutation] of a document. Different subclasses of Mutation will
/// perform different kinds of changes to a base document. For example, a
/// [SetMutation] replaces the value of a document and a [DeleteMutation]
/// deletes a document.
///
/// * In addition to the value of the document mutations also operate on the
/// version. For local mutations (mutations that haven't been committed yet), we
/// preserve the existing version for Set, Patch, and Transform mutations. For
/// local deletes, we reset the version to 0.

/// being applied to a [NoDocument]), even though they would on the backend.
/// This is because the client always combines the [TransformMutation] with a

/// the prior mutation resulted in a [Document] (always true for a
