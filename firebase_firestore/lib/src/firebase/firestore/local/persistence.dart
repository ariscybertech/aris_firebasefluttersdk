/// Persistence is the lowest-level shared interface to persistent storage in
/// Firestore.
///
/// * Persistence is used to create [MutationQueue] and [RemoteDocumentCache]
/// instances backed by persistence (which might be in-memory or SQLite).
///
/// * Persistence also exposes an API to run transactions against the backing
/// store. All read and write operations must be wrapped in a transaction.
/// Implementations of Persistence only need to guarantee that writes made
/// against the transaction are not made to durable storage until the
/// transaction commits. Since memory-only storage components do not alter
/// durable storage, they are free to ignore the transaction.
///
/// * This contract is enough to allow the [LocalStore] be be written
/// independently of whether or not the stored state actually is durably
/// persisted. If persistent storage is enabled, writes are grouped together to
/// avoid inconsistent state that could cause crashes.
///
/// * Concretely, when persistent storage is enabled, the persistent versions of
/// [MutationQueue], [RemoteDocumentCache], and others (the mutators) will defer
/// their writes into a transaction. Once the local store has completed one
/// logical operation, it commits the transaction.
///
/// * When persistent storage is disabled, the non-persistent versions of the
/// mutators ignore the transaction. This short-cut is allowed because
/// memory-only storage leaves no state so it cannot be inconsistent.
///
/// * This simplifies the implementations of the mutators and allows memory-only
/// implementations to supplement the persistent ones without requiring any
/// special dual-store implementation of [Persistence]. The cost is that the
/// [LocalStore] needs to be slightly careful about the order of its reads and
/// writes in order to avoid relying on being able to read back uncommitted
/// writes.
