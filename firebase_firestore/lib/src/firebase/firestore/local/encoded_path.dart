/// Helpers for dealing with paths stored in SQLite.
///
/// * Paths in their canonical string form do not sort as the server sorts them.
/// Specifically the server splits paths into segments first and then sorts,
/// putting end-of-segment before any character. In a UTF-8 string encoding the
/// slash ('/') or dot ('.') that denotes the end-of-segment naturally comes
/// after other characters so the intent here is to encode the path delimiters
/// in such a way that the resulting strings sort naturally.
///
/// * Paths are also used for prefix scans so it's important to distinguish
/// whole segments from any longer segments of which they might be a prefix. For
/// example, it's important to make it possible to scan documents in a
/// collection 'foo' without encountering documents in a collection 'foobar'.
///
/// * Separate from the concerns about path ordering and separation, SQLite
/// imposes additional restrictions since it does not handle TEXT fields with
/// embedded NUL bytes particularly well. Rather than deal with these
/// limitations, this implementation sidesteps the issue entirely by avoiding
/// NUL bytes in the output altogether.
///
/// * Taken together this means paths when encoded for storage in SQLite have
/// the following characteristics:
///
/// <ul>
/// <li>Segment separators ('/' or '.') sort before everything else.
/// <li>All paths have a trailing separator.
/// <li>NUL bytes do not exist in the output, since SQLite doesn't treat them
/// well.
/// </ul>
///
/// * Therefore paths are encoded into string form using the following rules:
///
/// <ul>
/// <li>'\x01' is used as an escape character.
/// <li>Path separators are encoded as '\x01\x01'
/// <li>NUL bytes are encoded as '\x01\x10'
/// <li>'\x01' is encoded as '\x01\x11'
/// </ul>
///
/// * This encoding leaves some room between path separators and the NUL byte
/// just in case we decide to support integer document ids after all.
///
/// * Note that characters treated specially by the backend
/// (e.g. '.', '/', and '~') are not treated specially here. This class assumes
/// that any unescaping of path strings into actual Path objects will handle
/// these characters there.
