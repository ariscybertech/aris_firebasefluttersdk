/// A Stream is an interface that represents a streaming RPC to the Firestore
/// backend. It's built on top of GRPC's own support for streaming RPCs, and
/// adds several critical features for our clients:
///
/// <ul>
/// <li>Exponential backoff on failure
/// <li>Authentication via CredentialsProvider
/// <li>Dispatching all callbacks into the shared worker queue
/// <li>Closing idle streams after 60 seconds of inactivity
/// </ul>
///
/// * Implementations of Stream should use AbstractStream and provide their own
/// serialization of models to and from the protocol buffers for a specific
/// streaming RPC.
///
/// ## Starting and Stopping
///
/// * Streaming RPCs are stateful and need to be [start]ed before messages can
/// be sent and received. The Stream will call its [onOpen] once the stream is
/// ready to accept requests.
///
/// * Should a [start] fail, Stream will call the [onClose] method of the
/// provided listener.
abstract class Stream<CallbackType extends StreamCallback> {
  /// Returns true if the RPC has been created locally and has started the
  /// process of connecting.
  bool get isStarted;

  /// Returns true if the RPC will accept messages to send.
  bool get isOpen;

  /// Starts the RPC. Only allowed if [isStarted] returns false. The stream is
  /// immediately ready for use.
  ///
  /// * When start returns, [isStarted] will return true.
  Future<void> start();

  /// Stops the RPC. This is guaranteed *not* to call the [onClose] of the
  /// listener in order to ensure that any recovery logic there does not attempt
  /// to reuse the stream.
  ///
  /// * When stop returns [isStarted] will return false.
  Future<void> stop();

  /// After an error the stream will usually back off on the next attempt to
  /// start it. If the error warrants an immediate restart of the stream, the
  /// sender can use this to indicate that the receiver should not back off.
  ///
  /// * Each error will call the [onClose] method of the listener. That listener
  /// can decide to inhibit backoff if required.
  void inhibitBackoff();
}

/// AbstractStream can be in one of 5 states (each described in detail below)
/// based on the following state transition diagram:
///
/// ```
///          start() called             auth & connection succeeded
/// INITIAL ----------------> STARTING -----------------------------> OPEN
///                             ^  |                                   |
///                             |  |                    error occurred |
///                             |  \-----------------------------v-----/

///                    backoff  |                                |
///                    elapsed  |              start() called    |
///                             \--- BACKOFF <---------------- ERROR
